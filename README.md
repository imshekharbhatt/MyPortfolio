This version elevates the professionalism while maintaining all your actual project structure and content. It's ready to copy-paste and will make a strong impression on visitors and potential employers/clients.

just provide me best modern and polished copy and paste read me which has my image in style also
We are going to create a README that includes an image of the owner (you) in the header or a section.
Since we cannot actually host the image, we will use a placeholder and you can replace it with your actual image.

However, note that GitHub README images are typically hosted elsewhere (like in the repo itself or via a CDN) and then linked.

We'll structure the README to have a header with your image, name, and a tagline.

Let's assume you have an image named profile.jpg in the images folder.

We'll use the following structure:

[Your Name] https://via.placeholder.com/100x100
But since we want to use your actual image, we can use:

https://images/profile.jpg

However, note that in GitHub README, the path to the image should be relative or absolute from the repo.

Alternatively, we can use an absolute path from the repository if the image is stored in the repo.

But note: the image might not be visible in the README if it's in a private repo or if the path is incorrect.

Let's use the absolute path from the repository:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imshekharbhatt/MyPortfolio/main/images/profile.jpg

But wait, the structure you provided doesn't have a profile.jpg in the images folder? You might have to adjust the path.

Alternatively, we can use a placeholder and you can replace the URL with your own.

We'll design a modern README with a header that includes your image, name, and tagline.

Let's create a centered header with a circular image.

We'll use HTML in the README because GitHub README supports limited HTML.

However, note that GitHub sanitizes HTML so we'll use a simple and safe design.

We can use a table or div to center the image and text.

But since GitHub doesn't support CSS, we'll use a table for centering.

Alternatively, we can use the following:

<div align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imshekharbhatt/MyPortfolio/main/images/profile.jpg" alt="Shekhar Bhatt" width="200" style="border-radius: 50%;"/> <h1>Shekhar Bhatt</h1> <p>Modern Web Developer & Designer</p> </div>
But note: the image might not be available at that URL until you upload it and the path is correct.

Let's adjust the image path accordingly. If you don't have an image, you can remove that part.

We'll create a README that is modern, polished, and includes your image.

Let's write the README accordingly.
